HTTP Methods :

1) XML HttpRequest : 
    -In built Browser Object _Can be used to request data from server
2)Client/server
3)HTTP
4)HTTP Calls
5)AJAX
=======================================================
onreadystatechange :
    -Event handler
    -whenever the readyState attribute gets changed 

readyState:
    It is occuring when the load state of the Page gets changed
states :
    0 : Request has not been sent
    1 : open state , 
    2 : Headers ->content type-Json
    3 : Loading 
    4 : Fully loaded 

Event Handler : 
    It is handling the events like click event on a button  .
    That piece of code we are going to write in this. 

Event : Any action that is happening on Web page like click on button, mouseover, Key press , 

onclick
onmouseover 

=================
1)Install Json server
2)Cretae 1 Json file db.json
3)Design 1 HTML Page - submit button
4)Write code in JS file 
5)Execute json-server --watch db.json
6)Execute HTMl Page on server 
==========================================
Synchronous and Asynchronous 

Synchronous : Sequential Execution

JS is single threaded application application.

function a()
{
    //code snippet
}
function b()
{
    //code snippet
}
function c()
{
    //code snippet
}
a()
b()
c()
======================
Asynchronous: It allows the execution of multiple methods simultaneously:
 JS : 
 - Callbacks 
 - Promises

 Callbacks : 
 - A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function

 function a()
 {}
 function b(int a, int b,callback)
 {
     callback()
 }

 b(10,20,a)
Advantage : 
1)To make application asynchronous
2)Multitasking at same time
3)b()->callback

user is raising any event, only then callback should execute ..


Promise : 

Multiple functions are executing simultanously ..

a(): Read data : time 10 - 1 day 
b() : Result from server
c() : Result from server

- Its an onject which will return a value 
sucess
failure 

states : 
Pending :
Fulfilled  : .then()
Rejected   : .catch()

axios : 
    It is a JS Library which is used to make HTTP request
